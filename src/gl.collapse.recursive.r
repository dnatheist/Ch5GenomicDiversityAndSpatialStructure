#' Recursively collapse a distance matrix by amalgamating populations
#'
#' This script generates a fixed difference matrix from a genlight object \{adegenet\} and from it generates a population recode
#' table used to amalgamate populations with distance less than or equal to a specified t. The script then repeats the process
#' until there is no further amalgamation of populations.
#'
#' The distance matricies are generated by gl.fixed.diff(), a recode table is generated using gl.collapse() and the resultant
#' recode table is applied to the genlight object using gl.pop.recode(). The process is repeated as many times as necessary to
#' yield a final table with no distances less than or equal to the specified threshold. The intermediate and final recode tables and distance matricies are
#' stored to disk as csv files for use with other analyses. In particular, the recode tables can be editted to replace Group1, Group2 etc with meaninful names.
#'
#' @param x -- name of the genlight object from which the distance matricies are to be calculated [required]
#' @param prefix -- a string to be used as a prefix in generating the matricies of fixed differences (stored to disk) and the recode
#' tables (also stored to disk) [default "collapse"]
#' @param threshold -- the threshold distance value for amalgamating populations [default 0]
#' @return The new genlight object with recoded populations.
